# Transition Guide for iOS SDK
This section covers all technical changes that should be considered when updating from previous versions, including, but not exclusively: API breaking changes or new functionality in the public API, major dependency changes, attribute changes, deprecation notices.

⚠️&nbsp;&nbsp;When updating your SDK version, __all__ changes/updates made in in the meantime have to be taken into account and applied if necessary.     
__Example:__ If you're updating from SDK version __3.7.2__ to __3.9.2__, the changes outlined in __3.8.0, 3.9.0__ and __3.9.1__ are __still relevant__.
